My coding classes are the reason I have made this website in the first place. I do the classes with my teacher (Sujata maam) and a girl called Nicole. 
I am frankly speaking, pretty surprised at how much I have learnt in just 10 classes. I have already started hosting websites! (This one being a prime example).
I am gonna to start making better projects pretty soon and am excited for tye next stage for my classes where I get to learn python, javascript, and more.
