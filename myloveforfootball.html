I used to go to a football academy for football training, and now all I do is go downstairs and play on concrete with my friends. I still am one of the best players in my society.
I desperately want to get into the school team for this years football selections. I havent been in it for a pretty long time, mainly because of covid19(WhyyyðŸ¤®). 
I had, am, and will always love football. It keeps me fit while having fun. There is just something so different and almost magical playing football with your friends,
being in an environment where you can talk while dribbling. It helps all of us to get better at the game!
