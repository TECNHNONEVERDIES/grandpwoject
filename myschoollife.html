I have to say, school is one of the most important aspects of life. Not just because of studies, but also because of the amount of friends, fun, and connections I have made over there.
Make it be school trips, projects or just some plain old padhai(ðŸ™„) I have always in general liked my school a TON. I have been taught by the same teacher 5 years in a row now!
(She's my hindi teacher). Every new grade has been a completely different experience and I always feel like pretty bad thinking that all of these experiences wont be able to be relived by me.
But it just keeps getting better! Especially now with my inner circle of 7F!
I feel like I should mention some of my favourite teachers here, but thats for later, after I am fully done with school and experienced it to the fullest.
My school friends are all mentioned in a section in the my friends part of the homepage of this website.
